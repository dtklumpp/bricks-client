# Brickstarter

## About

A site for crowdfunding social movements.  Users identify promising young visionaries, and browse funding goals, deadlines, and details to select a campaign.  As in groupon or kickstarter, when a pledge goal is met, all payments are made simultaneously.

People are hankering for a way to get involved to a meaninful extent in real social change; but too many feel at the moment like there's no way to make a difference, or that their individual effort alone won't count.  This is an attempt to get around that problem.

This repo contains the client-side React app; for the API in Django, look [here](https://github.com/dtklumpp/bricks-api)

## Usage

To clone and run this app, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) as well as [npm](http://npmjs.com) installed on your computer.

First, set up the API.  From the command line:

1. Clone the API repo (`https://github.com/dtklumpp/bricks-api`)
1. Enter the repository `$ cd bricks-api`
1. Enter the virtual environment `$ source .env/bin/activate`
1. Exit .env at any time with `$ deactivate`
1. Install dependencies with `$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
1. Run the application `$ python3 manage.py runserver`

*Note: if Postgres is not yet installed, you will need to run:

```
$ brew install postgres
$ brew tap homebrew/services*
$ brew services start postgresql
```

To setup the database and create an admin user, run these commands:

```
$ createdb bricks-db
$ python3 manage.py makemigrations
$ python3 manage.py migrate
$ python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

Next, set up the Client-side app:

1. Clone this repo: `$ git clone https://github.com/dtklumpp/bricks-client`
1. Enter the repository: `$ cd bricks-client`
1. Install dependencies with `$ npm install`
1. Run the application `$ npm start`
1. View the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

You should be good to go!

For testing, you can easily seed the database with some categories and projects by going to:

## Notes
This idea has gone through several iterations throughout the years, and more than a few changes of name (Crowd-Thunder, anyone?  Spare Change??).  Concerns about mis-use, as well as general lack of time on my part, have so far stalled its launch as a full-on non-profit.  However, if you're interested in helping me get this off the ground for real, please shoot me a message!
